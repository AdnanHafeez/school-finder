<p><b>The Premise</b></p>
There are currently multiple government provided, online search tools for finding schools. The school finder project sets about taking the best of each existing service, and combining them with a focus on heightened user experience. The school finder looks fresh and inviting, it has a smooth work flow and the results section provides vital information in two sections- an overview area, which is boxed out in grey; and a longer, narrative style school description which has been provided by the schools themselves and is intended to give users insight in the schools overall vibe and style.
<p><b>Goals</b></p>
The school finder is intended to provide NSW public school information to parents, students, future students and other stakeholders
<p><b>Development</b></p>
The school finder collects information from the user, and provides school information based on this collection. There are three main sections- school level (primary or secondary), support (optional), and user location. Results show user which school’s catchment area they fall into, as well as information about that school.
Version one provides information in two sections- an overview and a description provided by the school itself.
Version two is intended to increase useability, through the changed presentation of school information. Results would be divided into multiple sections, which are faster and easier for the user to process. Version two is reliant on data being collected from schools in a different format.
